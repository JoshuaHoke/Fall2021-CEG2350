# Lab 2 - NOT FINALIZED

## Setup

This lab assumes that you have completed [Lab 01](../Lab01/README.md)

- Ubuntu AWS machine exists and you can `ssh` in to the system
- You have connected to your GitHub repository for this course
  - If you forgot to bookmark it, the URL is:
  - `https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/ceg2350-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME`
- You have cloned the repository to you Ubuntu AWS system

## Lab Procedure

**For each step, include the command you used to perform the direction or answer the question posed.** If you did something "wrong" make a note of it in your lab. These are learning experiences - writing them down will help you ask good questions later.  

1. `ssh` in to your AWS environment. 
   - If you've forgotten your key, you'll need to provision a new stack in AWS Educate and create a new key.  
   - See [Remaking your AWS Educate environment](../../README.md) for instructions.
2. Go to the folder in which you cloned your Git repository for this course.
3. Create a directory called `Lab02`
4. In this directory, create a file called `README.md`
5. This `README.md` file is where you will put your answers to this lab. I recommend creating two connections to your Linux AWS system for ease of use.
   - At the top of the file please enter your personal details as follows:

```
Name: Your name
Email: Your email
```

**Useful commands: `man, mkdir, cd, ls, pwd, vim / nano`**

## Directories, Files, and Permissions

### Part 1: Play with directories & naming (3 pts)

1. In `Lab02`, create one directory called `DirA` and one directory called `Directory B`
2. What happens to the path name of `Directory B`? Which of the folders uses a better naming convention?
3. Rename `Directory B` to `DirB`  
   **Useful commands: `man, mkdir, cd, ls, pwd, mv`**

### Part 2: Create and edit a file (2 pt)

1. In `DirA`, create a file called `test.txt`
2. Put at least three lines of text in `test.txt` using `vim`  
   **Useful commands: `touch, vim`**

### Part 3: Play with hidden files (3 pt)

1. Make a copy of `test.txt`
2. Rename it to `.hidden.txt`
3. Type `ls`. Can you see both files? Use flags for `ls` to see your file.  
   **Useful commands: `cp, mv, ls`**

### Part 4: Play with permissions (5 pts)

1. What are the permission settings for user, group, and other of the files in `DirA`? What is the current  
   owner and group name?
2. Use `sudo` to make a copy of `test.txt` called `su-test.txt`
3. What are the permission settings for user, group, and other for `su-test.txt`? What is the current  
   owner and group name?
4. Can your user write to `su-test.txt`? If not, how can you write to the file without changing the permissions?
5. Change the file permissions so you can read and write to the file as your user (as in read / write without using `sudo`).  
   **Useful Commands: `chmod, chown, chgrp, ls, sudo, cp, cat`**

### Part 5: Play with hard links, soft links, and inodes (11 pts)

1. By default, what does `ln` followed by a filename do?
2. Use `ln` to create a file named `hard.txt` from `test.txt`
3. Note the inode number of `hard.txt` and `test.txt`. Are they the same?
4. Create a symbolic link called `sym.txt` from `hard.txt`
5. Note the inode number of `sym.txt`. Is it the same as `hard.txt`?
6. Delete `test.txt`. Is `hard.txt` and `sym.txt` still readable?
7. Delete `hard.txt`. Is `sym.txt` still readable? Why or why not?
8. Make a new file called `hard.txt` with some text in it. Can `sym.txt` be read now? Why or why not?
9. Move `hard.txt` to `DirB`. Can you read `sym.txt`?
10. Delete `sym.txt`
11. Create a symbolic link from `hard.txt` in `DirB` to `newsym.txt` in `DirA`  
    **Useful Commands: `ln, test, stat, cp, mv, rm`**

### Part 6: Updating the Git Repo (2 pts)

1. Use `git` commands to `add`, `commit` and `push` the `Lab02` folder and files you created into your repository. Write the commands you used and any headaches you ran into along the way.

## Submission

Please submit the Github URL / link for the `README.md` file containing answers to `Lab02` in the Pilot Dropbox 

Your URL should look something like: https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/ceg2350-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/blob/main/Lab02/README.md
